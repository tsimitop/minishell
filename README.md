**Minishell**

This is the first 42 group project. We worked together with [Yun](https://github.com/unow0517) to implement
a programme that mimics bash and to navigate git as a team for the first time.

To run the programme just make and run ./minishell. Then you can pretend it's bash to try it out.

"\",   ";",   "&&"   and   "||" were not implemented.
